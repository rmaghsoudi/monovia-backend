# Monovia

   Welcome to Monovia! This monopoly-esque trivia game was designed to ensure you have a great time playing and maybe learn
  a thing or two along the way! This app was created with a custom Ruby on Rails API backend, vanilla Javascript, jQuery, 
  HTML5 and CSS3 on the frontend. The questions are sourced from an external trivia API.

  Designed by: Romy Maghsoudi and Kesha "Rose" Lake

There's no penalty(except maybe your ego) for getting questions wrong, however, on double or nothing spaces you will lose all
of your money if answered incorrectly. The go to jail space will simply send you backwards to the jail space on the board.


  # Properties
  
  If you have enough money, a button will show up below your name that'll allow you to purchase the property. An emoji should 
populate the properties you've purchased.
